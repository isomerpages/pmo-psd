As the central HR agency, we lead the way in HR practices. We keep up-to-date with emerging trends and work practices to ensure our HR practices remain relevant and are able to meet the current and future needs of the organisation and our officers.

#### Always ready to change with the times
Excellence is one of our core values and that means we are committed to being progressive - always ready for change, discarding outmoded practices or thinking and moving with the times.

> "(Progressive HR) means keeping our ears close to the ground, opening our eyes to observe market changes, smelling opportunities to make improvements, thinking through needs and contextualising accordingly, and, most of all, having a heart for our people," Permanent Secretary, Public Service Division, Ms Yong Ying-I, 2015.

In 2015, we introduced extended paternity leave and re-employment of mature workers up to the age of 67.

Doing so sets the tone and sends the message that we are serious about ensuring our HR practices are progressive so as to support a first-class Public Service to achieve Singapore's goals and dreams.

#### Having a Heart for Our People
These progressive work practices are for our people - they help us to attract and retain the right officers with the motivation to serve; and also to nurture and develop our officers to realise their fullest potential while in the Service.

Good HR practices keep our officers engaged in meaningful work on a daily basis, in a manner that is most productive for them.

> "Itâ€™s a total commitment to ensure we have progressive HR practices to attract and retain good people in the system," Permanent Secretary, Public Service Division, Ms Yong Ying-I, 2015.
