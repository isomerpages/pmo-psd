#### From PS21 to Public Sector Transformation (PST)
From PS21 to the Public Sector Transformation (PST) movement, our emphasis has always been about keeping the Public Service relevant and agile in times of change.

The PS21 movement (1995-2011) saw the Public Service implement a range of programmes to innovate public services, improve policies and better deliver services to citizens.

Work improvements teams in every public agency saw officers collaborate on innovation projects. To deal with misdirected feedback or issues affecting several agencies, the “No Wrong Door” policy was introduced where the officer receiving the feedback saw to it that customers had only one touchpoint. Behind the scenes, officers from various agencies worked to find solutions.

This together with the First Responder Protocol, where the agency receiving the feedback coordinated the public response, led to improved response time and better citizen engagement.

Our public sector transformation efforts since 2012 kept our service to citizens in focus even as our officers engaged them to co-create solutions on the ground. These efforts  have borne fruit.


#### Stepping Up Transformation
With the speed of change ever increasing, we have stepped up transformation to build a future Singapore that is competitive and relevant to the world.

We want to think and act boldly to tackle challenges and exploit new opportunities. We do this knowing that we have

1. An ageing population and shrinking workforce;
2. Fiscal constraints;
3. Rising citizen expectations; and
4. Technological progress that is disruptive

But we also know that our citizens want to have a part in finding solutions, and digital solutions can help improve productivity.

To tap this, our transformation work will focus on:

1. Making Government digital as part of Singapore’s vision to be a Smart Nation: We will better leverage data and harness new technologies, and drive broader efforts to build a digital economy and digital society.
2. Improving service delivery: We will redesign services involving many agencies to be more customer-centric. One example is the Moments of Life project, a digital application launched in June 2018. Citizens now have seamless interactions with the Government through key life moments, starting with families with young children.
3. Working with citizens closely: We will create more opportunities to partner with citizens, businesses and non-government organisations to improve our policy-making.
4. Preparing every officer for the future: Every public officer will learn and reskill, and be adept to changes. Every officer will pursue innovation and new ways of working.
