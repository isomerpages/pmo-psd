In the Public Service, leadership is not about positions or titles. Public Service leaders are driven by a passion to serve Singapore and Singaporeans, and are dedicated to serve the people they lead. They lead by example and demonstrate the values of Integrity, Service and Excellence through their actions. As the global environment becomes increasingly complex, we need leaders who can provide Whole-of-Government perspectives and resolve systems-level tensions, as well as leaders with deep expertise in a range of areas to address more complex policy, operational and service delivery challenges.

The [Administrative Service](#) and the [Public Service Leadership Programme](#) aim to develop generalist and specialist leaders respectively in the Public Service.
