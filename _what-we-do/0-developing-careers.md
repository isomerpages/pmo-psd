PSD works with all employers in the Service to help attract, develop, retain and engage public officers to achieve our nation’s mission and vision.

#### We offer many opportunities within the Public Service
The Public Service employs around 145,000 officers in 16 Ministries and more than 60 Statutory Boards. Within the Public Service is the Civil Service, comprising about 85,000 officers in the Ministries. Our work is broadly categorised into five sectors:

Central Administration: Strengthening the core of the Singapore Public Service
* Security: Keeping Singapore safe, secure and influential
* Social: Growing the heartware of our society
* Infrastructure & Environment: Making our city-state a place to live in
* Economy: Driving our economy

#### We believe in developing your potential to the fullest
We believe every officer has talent and ability that should be developed to the fullest. That’s why every public officer gets up to 100 hours of training every year.

Training increases your skills, knowledge and capabilities. You’ll not only be able to perform your job better but also skill up for new/different positions in the Service.

#### We believe in facilitating your self-discovery.
Get to experience variety of jobs, different challenges and perspectives and get to work with colleagues in different agencies through job rotations.

Through these experiences, you’ll not only have a better grasp on how the entire Public Service works to help realize our nation’s dreams and goals but also discover for yourself where you will be able to make the most significant contribution.

#### We believe in supporting your career aspirations
At certain points in your career, you might want to enrol in a formal course of study like a postgraduate degree because you believe this will help you gain more skills or deeper expertise - skills and expertise that might help you unlock value and serve the nation more effectively.

We encourage such career aspirations and provide support, where suitable, in the form of unrecorded leave or sponsorship of course fees.
