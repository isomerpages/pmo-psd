There are, broadly, two types of roles at PSD - Analysts and Executives. We encourage our officers to take up job postings that will expose them to both types of work during their career with us.

#### Analyst
Analysts review new and existing policies. At PSD, they review leadership, capability development, and rewards and recognition policies. Day-to-day the work of an analyst involves:

* Environmental scanning, research and analysis of trends.
* Networking with industry on external practices to identify leading practices that can be adapted for use in the Civil Service.
* Scanning internal practices to understand the needs and challenges across the Civil Service.
* Developing and implementing pilot programmes, policies and solutions, as well as advising Ministries on implementation issues.

#### Executive​
Executives are at the heart of making things happen - they operationalise our initiatives. As an executive, you will be:

* Reviewing existing HR practices within PSD, and developing new HR initiatives on the full spectrum of HR functions, such as HR strategic planning, manpower deployment, recruitment, training and development, talent management and performance management.
* Ensuring financial discipline and the effective use of resources in finance, office management and general administration.
* Communicating policies and principles, and engaging public agencies to develop initiatives to drive a culture of change readiness, innovation and service excellence across the Public Service.
* Conceptualising and producing attractive branding campaigns and collaterals to market public service careers, and engaging public agencies for a coordinated approach to public service recruitment.
* Using traditional, new media, and marcoms platforms to communicate PSD’s policies and raise PSD’s profile, as well as engaging and developing relations with international counterparts to exchange views and learn from each other.
​
#### Job Rotation and Secondments
At PSD, you are encouraged to take up job postings in our different clusters - this way, you get to experience both policy and operations work and get a first-hand understand on how the two work together.

You may also be seconded to another ministry or statutory board for exposure.
