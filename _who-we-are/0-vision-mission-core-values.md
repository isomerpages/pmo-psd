#### Explaining our Mission
Our primary purpose is to steward – take care, nurture, guide and support – the health, well-being, performance, motivations and ethos of the Public Service.

We seek to build a united and effective Public Service that is trusted by the people whom we serve, and focused on wanting the best for Singapore and its citizens.

#### Developing Strong Leadership
We select and grow leaders.

We strengthen leadership abilities, behaviours and values at all levels.

We identify, groom and appoint top leaders across the Public Service.

We build a strong and united leadership community, bounded by a collective vision, and centered on the right values and ethos.

#### Developing Engaged Officers
We partner public agencies to develop our officers to not only be effective in what they do, but also be engaged to the greater purpose of their work, high in commitment and prepared to go the extra mile.

#### Building Future-Ready Organisations
We build capabilities at individual, team and organisational levels to directly address work challenges that public officers will face, and enable the Public Service to be ready for the future. Examples include putting in place individual development plans; and building engineering and service delivery capabilities.

#### Promoting Good Governance
We lead the way in what good government is about, how public organisations ought to run, and how they should act to meet citizens’ needs.

We serve as guardians of Public Service values and ethos, and we safeguard and uphold the reputation of the Public Service.

We provide sound advice on the structure of government.
