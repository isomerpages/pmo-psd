#### Public Sector Transformation Group
The Public Sector Transformation Group stewards transformation and change through system interventions, optimising resources and structures, building horizontal capabilities and reinforcing Public Service values.
Programme Office
"We accelerate the building of cross-cutting horizontal capabilities across the Whole-of-Government and partner with public agencies to implement them."

We accelerate the building of cross-cutting horizontal capabilities across the Whole-of-Government (WOG) and reinforce Public Service Values by:

* identifying common issues faced by public agencies, coordinate efforts and develop systemic and integrated plans across WOG to address them; and
* driving workforce solutions like strategic workforce planning, development of competency frameworks and careers pathways

In order to achieve the following outcomes:

* a capable workforce and strong leadership for future service delivery;
* Middle Managers who are equipped, engaged and empowered to make decisions and take appropriate risks;
* all officers identify with Public Service values and a One Public Service culture;
* engineering capabilities that are strategic and critical in the Public Service;
* a citizen-centric approach to integrating and delivering government services and information across agencies, according to citizens' key life moments; and
* a leading digital workplace that redefines officers' experience and enhances officers' capacity to be more effective in their work.
